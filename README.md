# Night of the Full Moon

Werewolves have overrun the area, and tonight, they are on the prowl…

Nothing stands between them and the hapless locals. Nothing, that is,
except you, your werewolf-proof bunker, your semi-automatic shotgun,
and your custom silver-tipped lead slugs.

A game written for the Game Off 2020 jam, with the theme “Moonshot”.
